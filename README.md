 Tic-tac-toe
Group Project: Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players

 Project Requirements

 1. Overview
The goal of this project is to create a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. The game should follow the traditional 3x3 grid format and adhere to the standard rules of Tic-Tac-Toe.

 2. Functional Requirements

 2.1 Game Rules
- 2.1.1 The game must follow the traditional rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:
  - 2.1.1.1 Players alternate turns. Player 1 uses X, and Player 2 uses O.
  - 2.1.1.2 Players take turns placing their marker (X or O) in any unoccupied square on the 3x3 grid.
  - 2.1.1.3 The game must detect when a player wins by aligning three identical markers in a row, column, or diagonal.
  - 2.1.1.4 If all squares are filled without a winning condition, the game must declare the result as a draw.
- 2.1.2 Once the game has ended, no further moves should be allowed, and a reset option should be provided to restart the game.

 2.2 User Interface (UI)
- 2.2.1 The game must have a graphical user interface (GUI) that includes:
  - A 3x3 grid for the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
  - Display areas indicating the current player’s turn (Player 1 or Player 2).
  - A message area to display the game outcome (win, draw, or error messages).
  - A Reset button that resets the game to its initial state.

 3. Non-Functional Requirements

 3.1 Performance
- 3.1.1 The game must respond to all user inputs (clicks, network moves) within 100 milliseconds.
- 3.1.2 In network mode, the latency between a player making a move and the other player seeing the move must be no greater than 300 milliseconds.
- 3.1.3 The UI must update in less than 100 milliseconds after any player’s move.

 4. Technical Requirements
 4.1 Programming Language
- 4.1.1 The project must be written in a language that supports both GUI and network functionality.
  - Recommended languages include Python, JavaScript, or Java.

 4.2 Networking
- 4.2.1 The game must use TCP/IP for online mode communication to ensure reliable data transmission.

 4.3 Testing
- 4.3.1 The project must include unit tests to cover:
  - Game logic (winning conditions, turns, move validation).
